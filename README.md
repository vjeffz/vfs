# VFS (Virtual File Splitter)

VFS is a Go library and CLI tool that allows you to:

- Encode a file into base64-encoded chunks stored as S3 object keys
- Restore a file by decoding these chunks
- Delete all objects under a given S3 prefix

Perfect for lightweight S3-based storage, validation-less chunking, or environments with limited API support.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Chunked file encoding to S3 (key names only)
- âœ… Safe restoration from S3 keys
- âœ… Parallel uploads/downloads (configurable via `S3_CONCURRENCY`)
- âœ… Prefix-safe key name sizing
- âœ… Clean command-line interface and Go API

---

## ðŸ“¦ Install

```bash
make build
./bin/vfs

```
import "github.com/vjeffz/vfs/vfs"

vfs := vfs.New()
vfs.Encode("file.txt", "s3://my-bucket/path/")
vfs.Restore("s3://my-bucket/path/", "file.txt")
vfs.Delete("s3://my-bucket/path/")
```

## ðŸ›  Usage

```
vfs encode <inputfile> s3://bucket/prefix/
vfs restore s3://bucket/prefix/ <outputfile>
